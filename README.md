# Benson - Exploring MTA Data

First project within the Metis Bootcamp. Asked to conceptualize a client problem and solution, my team chose to revlutionize the MTA. 

Have you ever been on a platform and the train was so crowded you had to wait for the next one? And then the next one? And so on?

Wouldn't it be great if we knew WHEN and WHERE trains were going to be so CONGESTED!?! Wouldn't it be great if you could just avoid the hassle????

We devised a metro route app that would included congestion traffic warnings if a given route met threshold congestion. 

Ipython Notebook file is the initial cleaning and analysis of the dataset.

PDF is the final client-ready presentation of our team's findings and proposal of metro route app.

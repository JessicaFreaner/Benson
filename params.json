{"name":"Benson","tagline":"Exploring MTA Data","body":"# Benson - Exploring MTA Data\r\n\r\nFirst project within the Metis Bootcamp. Asked to conceptualize a client problem and solution, my team chose to revlutionize the MTA. \r\n\r\nHave you ever been on a platform and the train was so crowded you had to wait for the next one? And then the next one? And so on?\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be great if we knew WHEN and WHERE trains were going to be so CONGESTED!?! Wouldn't it be great if you could just avoid the hassle????\r\n\r\nWe devised a metro route app that would included congestion traffic warnings if a given route met threshold congestion. \r\n\r\nIpython Notebook file is the initial cleaning and analysis of the dataset.\r\n\r\nPDF is the final client-ready presentation of our team's findings and proposal of metro route app.\r\n\r\n##Other Metis Projects:\r\n[Luther](jessicafreaner.github.io/Luther/ \"Luther\")\r\n[McNulty](jessicafreaner.github.io/McNulty/ \"McNulty\")\r\n[Fletcher](jessicafreaner.github.io/Fletcher/ \"Fletcher\")\r\n[Kojak](jessicafreaner.github.io/Kojak/ \"Kojak\")\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

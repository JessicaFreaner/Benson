Asked to conceptualize a client problem and solution, my team chose to revolutionize the MTA. \r\n\r\nHave you ever been on a platform and the train was so crowded you had to wait for the next one?\r\n![\"Crowded Station\"](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9892419/7356663/ae32f946-ecf7-11e4-9e2e-c477e7f503db.jpg)\r\n\r\nAnd then the next one? And so on?\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be great if we knew WHEN and WHERE trains were going to be so CONGESTED!?! Wouldn't it be great if you could just avoid the hassle????\r\n\r\n![\"Crowded Car\"](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9892419/7356660/ace14fac-ecf7-11e4-86f5-d14d7bbb8c33.jpg)\r\n\r\nWe devised a metro route app that would included congestion traffic warnings if a given route met threshold congestion. \r\n\r\niPython Notebook file is the initial cleaning and analysis of the dataset.\r\n\r\nPDF is the final [client-ready presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/JessFreaner/jtag-project-bensonrev06 \"Slideshare\") of our team's findings and proposal of metro route app.\r\n\r\n![ThisIsMetis](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/9892419/7356548/e1a3b3ac-ecf6-11e4-8fb6-be39f563742e.jpg) \r\n##Other Metis Projects:\r\n\r\n[Luther](http://jessicafreaner.github.io/Luther/ \"Exploring Movie Data\") - Exploring Movie Data\r\n\r\n[McNulty](http://jessicafreaner.github.io/McNulty/ \"Exploring Heart Health Data\") - Exploring Heart Health Data\r\n\r\n[Fletcher](http://jessicafreaner.github.io/Fletcher/ \"Exploring Data with NLP\") - Exploring Data with NLP\r\n\r\n[Kojak](http://jessicafreaner.github.io/Kojak/ \"Exploring NYC's Moving Populations\") - Exploring NYC's Moving Populations\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
